         <ul>
           <li><strong>1906</strong>- Grace Brewster Murray was born to Walter Fletcher Murray (Yale B.A. 1894, Phi Beta Kappa) and Mary Campbell Van Horne in New York City.</li>
           <li><strong>1928</strong>- Graduated from Vassar College with degrees in mathematics and physics.</li>
           <li><strong>1930</strong>- Received master’s degree in mathematics from Yale.</li>
           <li><strong>1931</strong>- Began teaching mathematics at Vassar while pursuing doctorate at Yale under computer pioneer Howard Engstrom.</li>
           <li><strong>1934</strong>- Completed Ph.D. in mathematics and mathematical physics from Yale and studied with the famous mathematician Richard Courant at New York University, during a one-year sabbatical</li>
           <li><strong>1943</strong>- Joined the U.S. Naval Reserve (Women’s Reserve) and assigned  to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University.
            Responsible for programming the Mark I and punching machine instructions onto tape. 
            Documented 561-page user manual for MARK-I</li>
           <li><strong>1945</strong>- Helped to develop the Mark II and Mark III computers for Navy at Harvard and She was the first refer to a computer problem as a “bug” and to speak of “debugging” a computer.</li>
           <li><strong>1946</strong>- left active service when the Navy turned down her request for a regular commission because of her age. Shortly thereafter Hopper left Harvard when it became clear she would not be promoted or granted tenure.</li>
           <li><strong>1949</strong>- Joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in Philadelphia as senior mathematician.</li>
           <li><strong>1952</strong>- Developed the first computer language “compiler” called A-0. Compilers translated mathematical code into machine-readable binary code, and they would eventually make it possible to write programs for multiple computers rather than a single machine. Developed Flow-Matic, the first programming language to use English-like commands.</li>
           <li><strong>1959</strong>- Promoted the language and its adoption by both military and private-sector users.</li>
           <li><strong>1971-1978</strong>- Served as a professorial lecturer in management sciences at George Washington University. Outside of academia, she organized myriad workshops and conferences to promote understanding of programming and expand the community of computer programmers.</li>
           <li><strong>1972</strong>- Received Yale’s Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal.</li>
           <li><strong>1977-1986</strong>- Received The Navy’s foremost propagandist for its computer program </li>
           <li><strong>1991</strong>- Awarded the National Medal of Technology, the nation’s highest technology award and was the first woman to be so honored as an individual.</li>
           <li><strong>1992</strong>- Worked as a senior consultant in public relations at the Digital Equipment Corporation till her death.</li>
           <li><strong>2016</strong>- Posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, in recognition of her remarkable contributions to the field of computer science.</li>
